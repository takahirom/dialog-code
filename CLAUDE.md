## About dcode
A wrapper tool for Claude Code that provides dialog-based permission confirmation.

## Commit Messages
- Keep commit messages concise and to one line
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")

## Testing
- If there were issues, do not fix first, please add the test first so we can reproduce and fix it
- Run tests before every commit
- Ensure all tests pass before pushing changes
